# Senior-Project
E-commerce site "Solid Teez" using Django, Python, HTML, and CSS

<h1>This is my e-commerce site project called Solid Teez.</h1

<h3>I used Django and python to develop and HTML and CSS to create and style the web pages. I also used pillow to uplaod product images and celery to perform calculations.</h3>

<h4>Some things to note are folder names. "Locallibrary" is the name of my project that I created in Django and "Polls" is the main application.
These are by-products from different tutorials that I watched and worked through and I never got around to starting a new project that was more appropriately named.
Besides that the other applications, "cart" and "orders" are straight forward.</h4>

<h5>To work with this code you would need to Download and install Django and Python

Next, you would need to create a file directory that will be the location, preferrably close to the root directory. 

Next you would need to start and activate the project "locallibrary" and start your apps within it.

Next you would create admin superuser

Next you would need to make migrations to django database

Next you would need to download and install pillow and celery with python

Next copy all files and folders from here to your apps and runserver</h5>
